All the codes are edited and tested by TeamWork410.

    The codes are tested in BorlandC3.1 OR Visual C++6.0. There are 
some difference between the two compilers. So, some codes should be
edited when being runned in VC or BC. We'll try our best to make the
codes to satisfy the both compilers.
